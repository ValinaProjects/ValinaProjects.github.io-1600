        <h1>Valina Maitland</h1>
<p>I'm a junior at Brooklyn College. I'm a computer science major with a minor in multi-media studies. My expected graduation date is Fall 2021
as I plan on taking courses during the summer semesters. If the classes I need are not available in the summer. I will graduate in Spring 2022. My hobbies include watching anime, playing video games, and watching musicals. Once the pandemic isn't as much of a concern, I would like to learn to skateboard and go on hikes with friends.</p>
